# Sehat Demo Video Script

**Target length:** 3 minutes
**Format:** Documentary-style — three visual layers:
1. **User footage** (color) — A real person from the community using Sehat on their phone. You film them and their screen.
2. **Builder face-cam** (B/W) — You (Sahaib) on camera explaining the problem, the why, the tech. Black & white aesthetic.
3. **Voiceover** — Your narration layered over user footage when needed.

**Edit style:** Cut between user footage and B/W face-cam. User footage carries the "wow" — face-cam carries the story.

## SCENE 1 — The Why (0:00–0:20)

**[Visual: B/W face-cam — you talking to camera]**

*"700 million Indians live in rural areas where there's 1 doctor for every 11,000 people. And when they finally reach one — they often speak a different language. 53% of emergency physicians say language barriers have caused critical incidents in their care. People die from treatable conditions because they didn't know it was urgent."*

**[Cut to: Text overlay on black — "Sehat (सेहत) — health, in Hindi"]**

*"So I built Sehat."*

---

## SCENE 2 — Meet the User (0:20–0:35)

**[Visual: Color footage — your friend/community member sitting with their phone. You're filming them. Brief establishing shot — their hands, the phone, maybe their face if they consent.]**

**[Voiceover:]**
*"This is [name/description — e.g., 'my neighbor auntie' / 'a friend who speaks Hindi']. They've never seen Sehat before. I'm going to ask them to describe some symptoms — in Hindi."*

**[Visual: They open Sehat on the phone. We see the welcome screen — ambient orb, waveform button, language pills.]**

---

## SCENE 3 — Voice Triage, Live (0:35–1:15)

**[Visual: Close-up on their phone screen as they tap the voice button and speak in Hindi.]**

*Them:* "Mujhe teen din se tez bukhar hai, sir me bahut dard hai, aur ulti bhi ho rahi hai"

**[Visual: Phone screen — thinking display streams, reasoning steps appear one by one]**

**[Voiceover:]**
*"That's Claude Opus 4.6 doing structured clinical reasoning — eight steps, in real-time. Symptom extraction, red flag screening, worst-first differential. The user sees the AI thinking through their symptoms."*

**[Visual: Result card appears on screen — Urgent, orange badge, action plan]**

**[Voiceover:]**
*"Urgent — go to a district hospital within 24 hours. It tells them exactly where to go, what to tell the doctor — in both Hindi and English — and what NOT to do. Like don't put toothpaste on burns, don't use a tourniquet for a snake bite. These are real dangerous home remedies used across rural India."*

**[Visual: User reacts / scrolls through the result]**

---

## SCENE 4 — Emergency Detection (1:15–1:40)

**[Visual: B/W face-cam — you talking]**

*"But what about real emergencies? You can't wait for AI reasoning when someone's having a stroke."*

**[Cut to: Color — phone screen. Type or show the Hindi text:]**
*"Mere papa ka chehra ek taraf se jhuk gaya hai aur haath kaam nahi kar raha"*
(My father's face is drooping and his arm isn't working)

**[Visual: Emergency banner appears INSTANTLY — red, shaking, 112 number huge]**

**[Voiceover:]**
*"Under 50 milliseconds. 200 keywords across 7 Indian languages — it catches stroke, cardiac arrest, poisoning BEFORE Claude even starts. The banner shows immediately while detailed guidance loads in parallel."*

---

## SCENE 5 — The Smart Parts (1:40–2:10)

**[Visual: B/W face-cam]**

*"Sehat isn't just a chatbot. It has 13 agentic tools that Claude decides when to use — patient history, symptom analysis, regional disease patterns, specialist routing. And it writes data back — clinical notes, follow-up schedules. Every session makes the next one smarter."*

**[Cut to: Color — phone screen showing:]**
- Tool calls appearing in the thinking display
- Follow-up question with tappable pill buttons (user taps one)
- Profile page with preferred language set

**[Voiceover:]**
*"When it needs more info, users just tap an answer — no typing needed. And you set your language once — the whole app loads in it. Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, Bengali, English."*

**[Cut to: Color — Doctor summary card / PDF export on screen]**

*"They get a bilingual doctor card they can take to their clinic visit."*

---

## SCENE 6 — Platform & Period Health (2:10–2:30)

**[Visual: Quick montage of phone screen — swipe between pages, 2-3 sec each:]**
1. Dashboard (health trends)
2. History (past sessions)
3. Reports (filterable, exportable)
4. Period Health page

**[Voiceover:]**
*"Full health platform — dashboard, history, reports. And a period health companion — because 71% of adolescent girls in India don't know about menstruation before their first period. Private, judgment-free health education in 7 languages."*

---

## SCENE 7 — Closing (2:30–3:00)

**[Visual: B/W face-cam — you, direct to camera]**

*"I built this solo in 4 days. 70 commits. 14,000 lines of TypeScript. Single Next.js app with Claude Opus 4.6 extended thinking, 13 agentic tools, Sarvam AI for Indian-language speech, and two-layer emergency detection."*

*"Sehat is triage, not diagnosis. Every single output directs to a real provider. We're not replacing doctors — we're helping 700 million people reach the right one. In their own language. When every minute counts."*

**[Visual: Cut to black — Sehat logo + "Built with Claude Opus 4.6" + GitHub URL]**

## Shooting & Edit Notes

### User footage (color)
- Film a real person who hasn't used the app before — genuine reactions matter
- Get close-ups of the phone screen (over-the-shoulder or top-down angle)
- If the room is noisy, have them type instead of speak — the demo is about the OUTPUT
- Make sure profile has a name set so Claude addresses them personally
- Pre-test the emergency sentence — have it ready to paste if voice is unreliable
- Film in decent lighting — phone screen should be clearly readable

### Face-cam (B/W)
- Good lighting on your face, clean background
- Look at the camera, not the screen
- Speak with conviction — you built this, you know the problem
- B/W color grading in post (or shoot with a B/W filter)
- Slightly desaturated / high contrast looks great

### Voiceover
- Record separately in a quiet room for clean audio
- Lay it over the user footage in editing
- Don't rush — let the visuals breathe, especially when the thinking display is streaming

### Edit rhythm
- User footage = the proof (let it play, show real reactions)
- B/W face-cam = the story (keep it punchy, 10-15 second segments)
- Voiceover = the glue (bridges between scenes)
- Transitions: simple cuts, no fancy effects — the content is strong enough

### Tools
- Edit in CapCut (free, mobile-friendly), DaVinci Resolve, or iMovie
- B/W: desaturate + boost contrast in color grading
- Text overlays: clean sans-serif, left-aligned, brief stats only
